    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

    // Let's say we have an array
    let players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    let players2 = players;

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    players3 = [...players];
    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
  players4 = [].concat(players);
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
  players5 = players.slice();  
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    let person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80,
      social: {
        twitter:'@elyas',
        facebook:'ahmedelyas'
      }
    };

    let elyas = person;
    // and think we make a copy:
    let elyas1 = Object.assign({},person,{age:22});
    // how do we take a copy instead?

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
